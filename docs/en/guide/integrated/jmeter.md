# JMeter
## Introduction

`smart-doc` has supported the generation of `JMeter` performance testing from version `3.0.1`, providing test capabilities.

## Generating JMeter Scripts

Usually, `smart-doc` is integrated during development to generate documentation.
You can directly use the `Mojo` or `Task` of the `Maven` or `Gradle` plugin to generate the `JMeter` performance testing script.
After running, you will get an `.jmx` document that can be imported into `JMeter`. Currently,
the generated scripts are relatively simple and lack high-level function support.

For details on how to use the `maven` plugin, please refer to:

Starting from version `3.0.4`, the community has introduced the feature to add a `Prometheus Listener`. 
To enable this feature, you need to add the `addPrometheusListener` configuration option in `smart-doc.json`.

```json
{
  "jmeter": {
    "addPrometheusListener": true
  }
}
```

## Importing JMeter

- First, download the latest `JMeter` from the `Apache` official website, [JMeter Download](https://jmeter.apache.org/download_jmeter.cgi)
- Start `JMeter`. Start `JMeter` according to your system. Usually, for `Mac` or `Linux`, you can start it directly with the `jmeter.sh` script.

After importing the script generated by `smart-doc` into `JMeter`, you can adjust it according to your needs and then perform testing.
